Ty Harness Chess Analysis Reporting Software version 2.


Written and tested on raspberry pi 1b only.  Should compile on any
Linux distro. but you'll need to tweak it for windows.  Mac??posix?? maybe.

It's a rehash of v1 written years ago just a work in progress
get it working on a raspberry pi.  I've took more out than
Ive left in.

V2  - dropped my old non standard file format and use
pgn

Added colour to the text.

Please note the code at best is clunky use at own risk.

Please improve it and enjoy your chess,

Ty Harness
